# Security Summary - Gift Voucher System Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Epic:** Epic 7 - Gift Vouchers

## Security Scan Results

### CodeQL Analysis
Ran CodeQL security analysis on all changed code files.

**Findings:**
- 3 alerts detected related to missing rate-limiting on admin voucher endpoints
- 10 similar alerts were filtered (existing codebase pattern)

### Alert Details

#### 1. Missing Rate Limiting - Admin GET Vouchers Endpoint
- **File:** `api/routes/voucher.routes.js` (line 242)
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Admin endpoint for listing vouchers is not rate-limited
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Endpoint is protected by `authMiddleware` and `checkRole(['admin'])`
  - Only accessible to authenticated admin users
  - Consistent with existing admin endpoints in the codebase
  - **Status:** Acceptable - matches existing architecture pattern

#### 2. Missing Rate Limiting - Admin POST Vouchers Endpoint
- **File:** `api/routes/voucher.routes.js` (line 273)
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Admin endpoint for creating vouchers is not rate-limited
- **Mitigation:**
  - Endpoint is protected by `authMiddleware` and `checkRole(['admin'])`
  - Only accessible to authenticated admin users
  - Consistent with existing admin endpoints in the codebase
  - **Status:** Acceptable - matches existing architecture pattern

#### 3. Missing Rate Limiting - Admin PUT Vouchers Endpoint
- **File:** `api/routes/voucher.routes.js` (line 323)
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Admin endpoint for updating vouchers is not rate-limited
- **Mitigation:**
  - Endpoint is protected by `authMiddleware` and `checkRole(['admin'])`
  - Only accessible to authenticated admin users
  - Consistent with existing admin endpoints in the codebase
  - **Status:** Acceptable - matches existing architecture pattern

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
✓ All admin endpoints protected with `authMiddleware` and `checkRole(['admin'])`
✓ Voucher redemption validates voucher status and expiry
✓ Payment intents use Stripe's security features

### Input Validation
✓ Voucher amounts validated (must be > 0)
✓ Email addresses validated
✓ Experience IDs validated against database
✓ Voucher codes validated before redemption

### Data Protection
✓ Sensitive payment data handled by Stripe (PCI compliance)
✓ Voucher codes generated with unique identifiers
✓ Database constraints prevent duplicate voucher codes

### Payment Security
✓ Stripe PaymentIntent used for secure payment processing
✓ Webhook signature verification (when STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is configured)
✓ Payment metadata includes voucher details for audit trail

### Email Security
✓ PDF generation uses pdf-lib (trusted library)
✓ Email sending through SendGrid with proper configuration checks
✓ Recipient emails validated before sending

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Rate Limiting:** Consider adding rate limiting to public voucher purchase endpoints to prevent abuse
2. **Webhook Security:** Ensure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is configured in production for webhook signature verification
3. **Email Validation:** Consider additional email verification for high-value vouchers
4. **Voucher Expiry:** Implement automated job to disable expired vouchers
5. **Audit Logging:** Add detailed logging for voucher creation and redemption events
6. **Monitoring:** Set up alerts for unusual voucher creation patterns

## Conclusion

The gift voucher implementation follows security best practices and is consistent with the existing codebase architecture. The identified alerts are low-severity and acceptable given the authentication and authorization controls in place. No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities were found.

**Overall Security Status:** ✓ PASS
